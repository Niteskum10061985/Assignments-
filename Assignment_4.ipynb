    "1.What exactly is []?\n",
    "Ans: This symbolize a list. It may contain a list of homogeneous/heterogeneous elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "spam=[2,4,6,8,10]\n",
    "spam.insert(2,'hello')\n",

    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Ans:1\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    "Ans:[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    "Ans:[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Ans: append() adds new value at the last of list\n",
    "     insert() adds new value at the specific location on user demand\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Ans: Remove & pop\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "And:\n",
    "List : Represented in square braces. Item assignmnet can be done.All sort of normal change operations can be done \n",
    "\n",
    "Tuple : Represented in normal braces . Item assignmnent cannot be done. Apart from count,index operations no oyjet operations can be done. Used in DB related integrations\n",

    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Ans: tuple = ( '',42)\n",

    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? \n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "l1=[6,7,8]\n",
    "tuple(l1)\n",
    "How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",

    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Ans: In nested list if we make any changes in original list it does affect the other image list when we use deep copy while it changes if we use copy. In deep copy it allocates different memory allocation which does not happen in copy().\n",
